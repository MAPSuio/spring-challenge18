# I will watch everything

You are really into movies, TV shows, etc. Today you decided to watch
everything, preferably in one sitting. You find stuff not listed at IMDb to be
too obscure, and decide not to watch any of that.

To make sure you have enough snacks, you need to know roughly how long you'll
be sitting. You dig into [IMDb's datasets](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/),
where you find that there are almost five million things to watch, but a lot of
them don't contain information about duration. You assume, for simplicity, that
they all last as long as the average of those that do contain information about
duration.

On what day are you done with this ambitious project? Assume you are starting
2018-5-7 at 17:00 a clock.

Provide the day in ISO 8601 (yyyy-mm-dd).

## Note

Regrettably, we provided the wrong answer for this task during the competition,
which was due to using whole number division when calculating an average.
